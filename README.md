What We Did in Our Analysis
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

We performed data cleaning tasks within Power BI, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting data types to prepare the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Using Power BI's data exploration capabilities, we conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into various aspects of Domino's Pizza sales, including total sales, sales trends over time, and popular pizza choices.
Sales Performance Analysis:

We analyzed sales performance metrics such as total sales, previous month sales, and year-to-date (YTD) sales within Power BI to assess business performance and identify areas for improvement.
Customer Preferences:

Within Power BI, we identified customer favorites by analyzing repeat orders of specific pizzas (pizza_name) and highlighted the most popular pizzas based on frequency of orders.
Interactive Dashboard Creation:

Using Power BI's visualization tools, we created an interactive dashboard that visualizes the analyzed sales data and provides users with the ability to explore trends, patterns, and insights.
